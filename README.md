# Character Concept: Hollowsaint
*using the 2024 rules unless mentioned otherwise*

---
## Core concept:
> My concept is to have a race of a kind of neither dead nor alive "humans" that are being kept alive due to some larvae fixing them. I wanted my character to be ashamed of their true nature and try to keep it hidden ([see here](#brood-disguise)) They're a cleric (exact domain still pending) that has thus now the ability to specifically hunt for undead and matching skills to do so. The character was supposed to be loyal to this cause and on the side of humans (but things could always change of course)

## Race: Necrosar 
> The Necrosar are the last remnants of a nearly extinct necromantic bloodline — humans whose bodies entered a grotesque but stable symbiosis with necrotic larvae. These parasites sustain the host’s body, granting unnatural endurance and a slow, crawling form of regeneration. Outwardly human, Necrosar blend in with the living... until their biology betrays them.

### ASI:
```
Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1.
```

### Languages:
```
You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.
```

### Creature type:
```
You are a humanoid.
```

### Size:
```
You are Medium.
```

### Speed:
```
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
```

### Deathless Nature:
> You're not truly dead, but not fully alive either — a condition represented by the following benefits:
```
 - You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
 - You have advantage on death saving throws.
 - You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
 - You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.
```

### Deathless Stagger:
> The larvae shield you from falling unconscious 
```
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
```

###  Necrotic Recomposition:
> Your flesh is rewoven slowly by the necrotic larvae inside you — a crawling repair process neither divine nor natural. Holy energies burn or paralyze the swarm, locking your body in decay until they recover.
```
Your body cannot be healed by magical or mundane means. Instead:
 - You regain hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the end of every turn (every 6 seconds), whether in or out of combat, as long as you are above 0 HP.
 - You cannot benefit from any form of magical or mundane healing: this includes spells, potions, hit dice, healing class features, and regeneration effects.
 - If you are reduced to 0 hit points, this regeneration halts entirely until you are stabilized.
 - If you take radiant damage or damage from a holy source, your regeneration is suppressed for 4 hours.
```

### Brood Disguise
> Your body is nearly indistinguishable from a human's under normal conditions.
```
Unless you are actively expelling larvae or suffering extreme physical trauma (e.g. a wound that causes over 50% of your HP in one blow), your condition remains undetectable.

=> Expelling larvae is a biological necessity that must occur before or during every long rest.
These expelled larvae may attempt to infest nearby corpses.
If not destroyed or contained, they can eventually reanimate those corpses as undead.

Creatures who closely examine you must succeed a DC 15 Medicine or Insight check to notice signs of your condition.

## Class: Cleric
*not sure atm, still thinking about it*

*either the unearthed arcana grave domain for the 2024 rules [click me](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/horror-subclasses/gPZTjw31gGeVdQKl/UA2025-HorrorSubclasses.pdf)*

*or the homebrew "ruin domain" as seen here [click me](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/1edhq0g/cleric_ruin_domain/#lightbox)*
