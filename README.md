# Character Concept: Hollowsaint
*using the 2024 rules unless mentioned otherwise*

---
## Core concept:
> Concept

## Race: Necrosar 
> The Necrosar are the last remnants of a nearly extinct necromantic bloodline — humans whose bodies entered a grotesque but stable symbiosis with necrotic larvae. These instinct-driven parasites sustain the host’s body, granting unnatural endurance and a slow, crawling form of regeneration. Outwardly human, Necrosar blend in with the living... until their biology betrays them.



### ASI:
```
Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1.
```

### Languages:
```
You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.
```

### Creature type:
```
You are a humanoid.
```

### Size:
```
You are Medium.
```

### Speed:
```
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
```

### Deathless Nature:
```
You're not truly dead, but not fully alive either — a condition represented by the following benefits:
 - You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
 - You have advantage on death saving throws.
 - You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
 - You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.
```

### Deathless Stagger:
```
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
```

###  Necrotic Recomposition:
> Your flesh is rewoven slowly by the necrotic larvae inside you — a crawling repair process neither divine nor natural. Holy energies burn or paralyze the swarm, locking your body in decay until they recover.
```
Your body cannot be healed by magical or mundane means. Instead:
 - You regain hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the end of every turn (every 6 seconds), whether in or out of combat, as long as you are above 0 HP.
 - You cannot benefit from any form of magical or mundane healing: this includes spells, potions, hit dice, healing class features, and regeneration effects.
 - If you are reduced to 0 hit points, this regeneration halts entirely until you are stabilized.
 - If you take radiant damage or damage from a holy source, your regeneration is suppressed for 4 hours.
```

### Brood Disguise
*(this is a roleplay thingy that you could use in/against my advantage)*
```
Your body is nearly indistinguishable from a human's under normal conditions.

Unless you are actively expelling larvae or suffering extreme physical trauma (e.g. a wound that causes over 75% of your HP in one blow), your condition remains undetectable.

Creatures who closely examine you must succeed a DC 15 Medicine or Insight check to notice signs of your condition.
